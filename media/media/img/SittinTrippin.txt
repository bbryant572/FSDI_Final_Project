Sometimes I really get trippin' on shit

I let things really bother me


Until, I remember

that we're all going to die


together, everything 

at every point ever in existence

is simultaneously experiencing entropy


This incredibly humbling thought grounds me

in my intrinsically beautiful insignificance

and once again


I resonate wholly 

striving to learn, teach, help, play, and be grateful


let's make life interesting and memorable for one another

through kindness and love


we're all falling apart

together, at wildly independent speeds


as we dance on the sands of the same time

a corporeal tornado temporarily aspin


upon our little bits of perceived beach

till the tide changes

To stare into the eyes of another creature

with whom you share no language or seemingly common ground

the time spent together builds bridges in the mind

all that much easier are our similarities to find


we sleep

we eat

we live on our Earth

we die

we fear

we came from a birth

we see with eyes

we taste with tongues

we walk on legs

we breathe with lungs


we earthlings are similar

in more than many ways

so let us let each other live

and find beauty in our days


our time alive simply does not last

set all those you meet on a better path
